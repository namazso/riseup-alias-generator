# üê¶ Riseup alias generator

Generate email address aliases on riseup.net

## Why?

This is a simple script that encourages and makes it easy to use a different email alias for each service you use, making these unlinkable across services.

Keeping your accounts unlinkable have several benefits:

* Security: If one site is breached, the data won't be linkable to your other accounts
* Privacy: Ad companies also try to link accounts based on email addresses.
* Spam protection: When a site is breached and the email you used starts getting spam, you can simply delete the alias.

## How?

1. Download [riseup-alias.ps1](https://github.com/namazso/riseup-alias-generator/raw/master/riseup_alias.ps1)
2. Change username and password on the top of the script
3. (Preferably) make a shortcut for running
4. On run, the script generates a new alias, adds it to riseup and copies it to clipboard.
